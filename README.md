RFduino Library: Talk to your RFDuino board from your Android phone! 

= Getting Started: Hardware and Software Setup =

If you're on the page to repository, you probably already have (and if not, you'll need) the following things: 

1. An RFDuino board (http://www.rfduino.com/rfd90101-teaser-kit.html) 
2. A USB connector of some kind to program it with Arduino sketches (http://www.rfduino.com/rfd90101-teaser-kit.html) 
    as well as some kind of cable to upload sketches (TODO: link to the correct HW cable.)
3. The software IDE that allows you to program your RFDuino (TODO: Link here) 

4. If all you want is a pre-built Android app to test your board with, you just need the latest example app
   (TODO: link here to latest APK)

5. If you want to build your own Android app, then you need to start with the Android Developer's guide
   (http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html)
   According to the tutorial, you'll need:
  5a. An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) such as Eclipse or AndroidStudio. The guide also details how to 
      compile on your own for the advanced hardcore programmer.
  5b. The Android SDK (Software Development Kit): http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

  This, like the rest of this repository, is released under the LGPL.  To comply with the license, when you build 
  your Android application, make sure that this library is NOT code obscured by Android's "Proguard" feature.
